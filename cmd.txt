    One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
    declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
    "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
    node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

    babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
    is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
    ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
    your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
    go away.

quill.js:4237 [Deprecation] Listener added for a 'DOMNodeInserted' mutation event. This event type is deprecated, and will be removed from this browser very soon. Usage of this event listener will cause performance issues today, and represents a large risk of future site breakage. Consider using MutationObserver instead. See https://chromestatus.com/feature/5083947249172480 for more information.
